# Remotely-controlling-switches-using-human-elicitations

The aim of this project is to present the design of the low-cost voice recognition-based switch control system which would help differently abled people to control switches with just voice commands.  
This particular idea can be used to control doors remotely and as well as in moving wheelchairs from one place to another without any help from someone else.  
Considering the current situation of COVID-19, this project can also be used since virus sustains more on metallic surfaces such as door handle, so using this project we can avoid touching the door locks.
